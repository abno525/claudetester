# Minecraft CAPTCHA Wiki

Welcome to the Minecraft CAPTCHA wiki — the documentation hub for a CAPTCHA verification system built around the Minecraft crafting table interface.

## What is Minecraft CAPTCHA?

Minecraft CAPTCHA is a human verification system that replaces traditional CAPTCHAs (distorted text, image grids, etc.) with an interactive Minecraft crafting challenge. Users are presented with a crafting table, given a set of materials, and asked to craft a specific item. Correct crafting verifies the user is human.

## Why Minecraft Crafting?

- **Familiar UX**: Millions of players already know how to use a crafting table
- **Hard to automate**: Crafting recipes require spatial reasoning and game knowledge, making bot-solving non-trivial
- **Engaging**: Users interact with a fun mini-game instead of a frustrating puzzle
